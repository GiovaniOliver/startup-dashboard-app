export const faqs = [
  {
    question: "When should I start working on my startup idea?",
    answer: "The best time to start is now! However, ensure you've validated your idea with potential customers before investing significant time and resources. Start with customer interviews and build a simple MVP to test your assumptions."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a co-founder?",
    answer: "While not mandatory, having a co-founder can be beneficial. They provide complementary skills, share the workload, and offer emotional support. However, choose carefully - a bad co-founder relationship can sink your startup. It's better to start solo than with the wrong co-founder."
  },
  {
    question: "How much money do I need to raise?",
    answer: "It depends on your business model and goals. Calculate your runway (how long the money will last) and aim for 18-24 months. Consider bootstrapping initially if possible, and only raise when you have clear milestones to achieve with the capital."
  },
  {
    question: "What should be in my pitch deck?",
    answer: "A typical pitch deck includes: Problem, Solution, Market Opportunity, Product Demo, Business Model, Traction, Competition, Team, Financials, and Ask. Keep it to 10-15 slides and focus on storytelling."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I hire my first employee?",
    answer: "Hire when you have repeatable work that doesn't require the founder's unique skills, and when the ROI of that hire is clear. Start with contractors or part-time help before committing to full-time employees."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I validate my startup idea?",
    answer: "Talk to potential customers, conduct surveys, build a landing page to gauge interest, create a simple MVP, and try to get people to pay for your solution. Real validation comes from customers willing to pay, not just positive feedback."
  },
  {
    question: "What legal structure should I choose?",
    answer: "For most tech startups planning to raise venture capital, a Delaware C-Corporation is standard. For smaller businesses or lifestyle businesses, an LLC might be more appropriate. Consult with a lawyer to determine what's best for your specific situation."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find angel investors?",
    answer: "Network through startup events, accelerators, and warm introductions. Platforms like AngelList can help. Remember, the best way to get investor attention is through referrals from people they trust - other founders, investors, or industry experts."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between pre-seed, seed, and Series A?",
    answer: "Pre-seed is the earliest stage, often friends and family funding. Seed is for companies with an MVP and some early traction. Series A is for companies with proven product-market fit and clear growth metrics. Each stage typically involves larger amounts and more stringent requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I protect my intellectual property?",
    answer: "File for patents if you have truly novel inventions, register trademarks for your brand, and use NDAs when sharing sensitive information. For most software startups, copyright protection (automatic) and trade secrets are sufficient."
